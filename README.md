# MDO-TenantPayloads
This repository contains tenant-specific HTML/CSS styled tenant payloads for use in Microsoft Defender for Office 365‚Äôs Attack Simulation Training (AST in MDO). It focuses on English and Dutch payloads. These templates are designed to help organizations simulate phishing attacks and train users to recognize and respond to such threats effectively. The repository will be continuously updated with new payloads.

## üìÑ About
The payloads in this repository are crafted to mimic real-world phishing scenarios, enabling administrators to conduct realistic simulations within their MDO environment. By deploying these simulations, organizations can assess user susceptibility to phishing and enhance their security awareness programs.

For detailed guidance on setting up and utilizing MDO's Attack Simulation Training, please refer to the documentation available on [vand3rlinden.com](https://vand3rlinden.com/post/mdo-attack-simulation/).

## üìÅ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into directories representing different types of phishing simulations:

* **CredentialHarvest**: Contains HTML payloads that simulate credential harvesting attacks.
* **MalwareAttachment**: Includes HTML payloads that mimic malware attachment scenarios.
* **More to come**: The repository will be continuously updated with new payloads.

Each directory contains HTML files that can be imported into MDO's Attack Simulation Training module.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vand3rlinden/MDO-TenantPayloads.git
   ```

2. **Access MDO Attack Simulation Training**:
   Navigate to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and go to the Attack Simulation Training section.

3. **Import Payloads**:
   Use the HTML files from the desired directory in this repository to create new simulation payloads within MDO.

4. **Launch Simulations**:
   Configure and launch simulations targeting specific user groups to assess their response to phishing attempts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
The provided HTML payloads can be customized to better fit your organization's context:

* **Branding**: Modify logos and color schemes to match your organization's branding.
* **Content**: Adjust the messaging to reflect scenarios relevant to your users.

Ensure that any modifications maintain the realism of the simulation to effectively train users.

By utilizing these simulation payloads, organizations can proactively train their users to recognize and respond to phishing threats, thereby strengthening their overall security posture.
