  <p>Hi ${firstName},</p>

  <p>A new parking permit has been issued for your use in our company parking facilities.</p>

  <p>Please find attached to this email your new parking permit. It's important that you take the following actions as soon as possible:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Print out the attached parking permit.</li>
    <li>Display the printed permit clearly on your vehicle's dashboard whenever you park in company facilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This new permit is effective immediately and replaces any previous parking permits you may have. To avoid any parking violations or potential towing, please ensure you have the new permit displayed by your next working day.</p>

  <p>If you have any issues printing the permit or any questions about parking regulations, please submit a ticket with the Facilities Management Team.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.</p>

  <p>Best regards,<br>
  Facilities Management</p>
